## Plan

1. Build a thing in Python that takes a list of strings and randomly logs one of the strings.

2. Use the fun Pything (Python thing) to choose the next component that'll be built in the Build an Accessible React Component series.

3. Fight with Storybook for the a11y-components library.

## How it went

1. The picker

- Updated Python with `brew install python`
- Created a 'Hello, World!' script and ran it with `python3 random-picker.py`
- Used `input` to prompt user input
- Made the script take input and a build a list until it receives "nope"
- Used `random.choice` to pick a random item from a list

2. The picker picked the [Alert Dialog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alertdialog) widget!! ðŸŽ‰

3. Storybook wasn't fun at first, then I decided to start from scratch. I followed [this guide](https://fathomtech.io/blog/create-a-react-component-library-using-create-react-app/) for making a reusable component library using CRA. The package is now published at [npmjs.com/package/a11y-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/a11y-components)!

## Things to do

1. Add more channel point redemptions (hydrate, change knit hat)
2. Upload frog emote
3. Add tests & a PR check back to a11y-components
4. Add SCSS back to a11y-components
